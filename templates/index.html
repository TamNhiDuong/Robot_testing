    <h1>Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!</h1>
    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You start with 100 bet points.</li>
      <li>
        Choose a difficulty level:
        <ul>
          <li>Easy: 10 guesses</li>
          <li>Hard: 5 guesses</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Place a bet with your bet points for each round.</li>
      <li>
        Guess the number between 1 and 100:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you guess correctly, you can choose to double your prize or take
            your winnings.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose to double, you have a 50% chance to either double your
            prize or lose it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you run out of guesses, you can try to save your bet:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you try to save, you have a 50% chance to keep your bet points or
            lose the bet points you placed for that round.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        After each round, you can decide to continue playing or finish the game
        and save your score to the scoreboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game ends when you choose to finish or you have no bet points left.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The high scores are saved and displayed on the scoreboard. Try to get your
      name in the top 10!
